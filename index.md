The Earth Data Challenge (EDC) is a semester-long, team-based program hosted by [GRI](https://geospatial.wustl.edu) and [EEPS](https://eeps.wustl.edu), focused on developing skills in AI-assisted workflows, cloud computing, and Earth data analysis. 

No prior experience required. **Register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuG6FXZ98Yiw8Ac5eKnTPhtbIbjQdUIkpY-LNGLEkwWKkHoQ/viewform)** to participate.

## What EDC will cover

- Cloud computing with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)
- [AI-assisted workflows](vibe-coding.md)
- [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and Python programming
- Data analysis and visualization, including [hyperspectral data](https://www.planet.com/products/hyperspectral/) (Planet Tanager)
- Version control with [Git/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)
- [Reproducible](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/), [open-science](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) practices
- Collaborative technical project skills that translate directly to research and industry careers

These are practical, career-relevant skills used in geoscience, geospatial analytics, environmental consulting, government agencies, data science, and many other fields.

## Schedule

All sessions are at **noon in Rudolph 301**.

| Date | Event |
|:-----|:------|
| January 30 | Overview and Exploring Cloud Dataset |
| February 13 | Jupyter and Google Earth Engine |
| February 27 | Git/GitHub, Team Formation, and Mentoring |
| March 20 | EDC Team Updates, Mentoring, and Questions |
| April 24 | EDC Team Presentations and Awards |


## How It Works
Form a team of 2–5 students, choose a project, develop a reproducible Jupyter notebook, and present your results at the end of the semester. We provide cloud computing access, example notebooks, curated datasets, and mentorship.

The goal is to get acquainted with modern data workflows, not to produce exhaustive research. Projects are intentionally small-scale and skill-focused. Expect a total time commitment of roughly 10–12 hours over the semester, including the scheduled sessions. 

We are excited about [Planet Tanager](https://www.planet.com/products/hyperspectral/) hyperspectral imagery as a new and excited data source, but teams are free to work with any publicly available cloud-hosted Earth datasets that fit their interests.

## Who Can Participate

Open to undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in any field.
