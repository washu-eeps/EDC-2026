The Earth Data Challenge (EDC) is a semester-long, team-based program hosted by GRI and EEPS. Participants learn modern Earth data workflows—cloud computing, Jupyter notebooks, and remote sensing—while working collaboratively on projects using hyperspectral satellite data.

No prior programming experience required.

## What You'll Learn

- Cloud-based data analysis using Google Cloud and Jupyter notebooks
- Remote sensing workflows with hyperspectral data (Planet Tanager)
- Reproducible, open-science practices
- Collaboration tools including GitHub and Google Earth Engine

These are practical, career-relevant skills used across geospatial analytics, environmental consulting, government agencies, and data science.

## Schedule

All sessions are at **noon in Rudolph 301**.

| Date | Event |
|:-----|:------|
| January 30 | Introduction and Overview |
| February 13 | Cloud Computing, Jupyter, and Google Earth Engine |
| February 27 | Team Formation and Project Kickoff |
| March 20 | Mid-Semester Check-in |
| April 24 | Final Presentations and Awards |

## How It Works

Form a team of 2–5 students, choose a project, develop a reproducible Jupyter notebook, and present your results at the end of the semester. We provide cloud computing access, example notebooks, curated datasets, and mentorship.

## Who Can Participate

Open to undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in any field.
