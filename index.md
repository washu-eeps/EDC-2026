The Earth Data Challenge (EDC) is a semester-long, team-based program hosted by [GRI](https://geospatial.wustl.edu) and [EEPS](https://eeps.wustl.edu). Participants learn modern Earth data workflows—cloud computing, Jupyter notebooks, and remote sensing—while working collaboratively on projects using hyperspectral satellite data.

No prior programming experience required.

## What You'll Learn

- Cloud-based data analysis using [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)
- Remote sensing workflows with [hyperspectral data]([https://www.planet.com/products/hyperspectral/](https://www.planet.com/constellations/tanager/)) (Planet Tanager)
- Reproducible, open-science practices
- Collaboration tools including [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) and [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)

These are practical, career-relevant skills used across geospatial analytics, environmental consulting, government agencies, and data science.

## Schedule

All sessions are at **noon in Rudolph 301**.

| Date | Event |
|:-----|:------|
| January 30 | Introduction and Overview |
| February 13 | Cloud Computing, Jupyter, and Google Earth Engine |
| February 27 | Team Formation and Project Kickoff |
| March 20 | Mid-Semester Check-in |
| April 24 | Final Presentations and Awards |

## How It Works

Form a team of 2–5 students, choose a project, develop a reproducible Jupyter notebook, and present your results at the end of the semester. We provide cloud computing access, example notebooks, curated datasets, and mentorship.

The goal is to get acquainted with modern data workflows, not to produce exhaustive research. Projects are intentionally small-scale and skill-focused. Expect a total time commitment of roughly 10 hours over the semester, including the scheduled sessions.

## Who Can Participate

Open to undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in any field.
