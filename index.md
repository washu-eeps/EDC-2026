The Earth Data Challenge (EDC) is a semester-long, team-based program hosted by [GRI](https://geospatial.wustl.edu) and [EEPS](https://eeps.wustl.edu). EDC is a team-based program focused on AI-assisted coding, cloud computing, and data analysis. 

No prior programming experience required.

## What EDC will cover

- Cloud computing with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)
- [AI-assisted coding](vibe-coding.md) workflows
- [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and Python programming
- Satellite data analysis and visualization, including [hyperspectral data](https://www.planet.com/products/hyperspectral/) (Planet Tanager)
- Version control with [Git/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)
- [Reproducible](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/), [open-science](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) practices
- Collaborative technical project work — skills that translate directly to research and industry careers

These are practical, career-relevant skills used across geospatial analytics, environmental consulting, government agencies, and data science.

## Schedule

All sessions are at **noon in Rudolph 301**.

| Date | Event |
|:-----|:------|
| January 30 | Introduction and Overview |
| February 13 | Cloud Computing, Jupyter, and Google Earth Engine |
| February 27 | Team Formation and Project Kickoff |
| March 20 | Mid-Semester Check-in |
| April 24 | Final Presentations and Awards |


## How It Works
Form a team of 2–5 students, choose a project, develop a reproducible Jupyter notebook, and present your results at the end of the semester. We provide cloud computing access, example notebooks, curated datasets, and mentorship.

The goal is to get acquainted with modern data workflows, not to produce exhaustive research. Projects are intentionally small-scale and skill-focused. Expect a total time commitment of roughly 10–12 hours over the semester, including the scheduled sessions. 

We'll feature [Planet Tanager](https://www.planet.com/products/hyperspectral/) hyperspectral imagery in our tutorials, but teams are free to work with any publicly available cloud datasets that fit their interests.

## Who Can Participate

Open to undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in any field.
